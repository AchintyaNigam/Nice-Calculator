# Nice-Calculator
#This calculator was made so that I could practice the things I have learned until now in computer science
#it  has two modes: NSQ and SEQ
#NSQ mode lets you make calculations using the BODMAS rule (Brackets Over Division Multiplication Addition Subtraction). it uses STACK data structure
#SEQ mode lets you make calculations one after the other.
